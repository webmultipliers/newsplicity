# Newsplicity â€” Under Construction

Newsplicity is an extremely opinionated template/boilerplate for building news sites. It is designed to be a starting point for building a news site with WordPress and cover all tech aspects of digital news publishing including key vendor choices. 

There are endless ways to accomplish this goal, but this is the _newsplicity_ way.

If you discover this project and would like to contribute, please reach out to [mailto:vinny@vinnysgreen.com](vinny@vinnysgreen.com) or @vinnysgreen on twitter, linkedin, and github.

Much of this readme is dynamically generated directly from the newsplicity template staging server every few minutes and the newsplicity template which is updated every few hours.

The dev ops will improve over time.
